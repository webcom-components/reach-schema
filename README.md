# reach-schema

This repository contains the current JSON Schema of the Reach base.

See https://webcom-components.github.io/reach-schema/#draft-00

The corresponding Security Rules can be found here https://webcom-components.github.io/reach-schema/draft-00/security/rules.json.

You will need to import those rules in order to enforce security in your application. Take a look at the [test results](https://webcom-components.github.io/reach-schema/draft-00/security/report/) to understand these rules.
